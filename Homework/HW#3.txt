## ASP.NET HW3

#### Homework Questions
1. What is the most important part of an ASP.NET Core 3 application?
The data model is the most important part of any ASP.NET Core application. 
The model is the representation of the real-world objects, processes, and rules that define the subject, known as the domain, of the application.

1. What is the domain model?
The domain model contains the C# objects (known as domain objects) that make up the universe of the application and the methods that manipulate them. In most projects, 
the job of the ASP.NET Core application is to provide the user with access to the data model and the features that allow the user to interact with it.

1. Where are the model classes in an ASP.NET Core 3 application placed?
Models Folder

1. How many action methods can a controller class define? 
A single controller class can define multiple action methods, and the convention is to group related actions together in the same controller.

1. What is a tag helper?
Tag helper attribute, which is an instruction for Razor that will be performed when the view is rendered.
Tag helper tells Razor to insert a URL for an action method defined by the same controller for which the current view is being rendered.

1. What does the asp-action attribute do?
The asp-action attribute is an instruction to add an href attribute to the a element that contains a URL for an action method.
Tells Razor to insert a URL for an action method defined by the same controller for which the current view is being rendered.

1. What is the difference between HTTP GET and HTTP POST? This is an important question, and you
should understand the difference.
A GET request is what a browser issues normally each time someone clicks a link. 
This version of the action will be responsible for displaying the initial blank form when someone first visits /Home/RsvpForm.

1. What is model binding?
a useful ASP.NET Core feature whereby incoming data is parsed and the key/value pairs in the HTTP request are used to populate properties of domain model types.
Model binding is a powerful and customizable feature that eliminates the grind of dealing with HTTP requests 
directly and lets you work with C# objects rather than dealing with individual data values sent by the browser.

1. Why should we validate user data? How do we validate user data?
Without validation, users could enter nonsense data or even submit an empty form. In an ASP.NET Core application, validation rules are defined by applying 
attributes to model classes, which means the same validation rules can be applied in any form that uses that class. 

1. What, specifically, is the ModelState.IsValid property?
The Controller base class provides a property called ModelState that provides details of the outcome of the model binding process. If the ModelState.IsValid property returns true, 
then I know that the model binder has been able to satisfy the validation constraints I specified through the attributes on the GuestResponse class. 

1. What does the asp-validation-summary do?
The asp-validation-summary attribute is applied to a div element, and it displays a list of validation errors when the view is rendered. 
The value for the asp-validation-summary attribute is a value from an enumeration called ValidationSummary, 
which specifies what types of validation errors the summary will contain.

1. Static content consists of content such as images, script files, style files, etc. In an ASP.NET Core
application, what is the name of the folder that cotains static content?
The convention in ASP.NET Core projects is that static content delivered to clients is placed into the wwwroot folder and organized 
by content type so that CSS stylesheets go into the wwwroot/css folder, JavaScript files go into the wwwroot/js folder, and so on.

1. What is Bootstrap? Who developed Bootstrap? Is Bootstrap a proprietary package? If not, what is
it?
Bootstrap defines classes that can be used to style forms.
Bootstrap, which is a good CSS framework originally developed by Twitter that has become a major open source project and a mainstay of web application development.
Bootstrap is a client side development package.
