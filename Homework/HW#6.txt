2. What is the convention for creating unit tests in ASP.NET Core applications?
Use the dotnet new command with the project template for your preferred test framework

3. Name three unit test project tools used for ASP.NET Core applications.
MS Test Framework

Create mock implementations of the objects that the component under test requires.

10. What is a mocking package? What does it do?
A mock version of something is an object that can act like the real thing but can be controlled in test code. I can use the Moq framework to create a fake IDataSource object without having to define a custom test class
